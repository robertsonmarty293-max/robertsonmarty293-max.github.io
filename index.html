          <h3>Using Sublime to code HTML</h3>


          <p>Before the Baseball Writers' Association of America assumed the MVP selection reins in 1931, the process was a bit chaotic. Both leagues gave out an award, the AL starting in 1922 and the NL in 1924. (And even before that, there was a proto version -- the Chalmers Award, which was given out from 1911 to 1914.)</p>

          <p>The criteria between the leagues were not compatible: <a href="https://www.espn.com/">The AL would not allow repeat winners, but the NL didn't care.</a> Though Babe Ruth should have racked up five or six MVP awards during that span, he won only one -- in 1923. Rogers Hornsby won twice on the NL side. As with many old-time practices now viewed from the perspective of the present, it's weird.</p>

          <p>Anyway, this would settle the <em>Raleigh-Judge</em> debate because Judge wouldn't be eligible. Heck, he wouldn't have been eligible last year, either. That would have been good news for Bobby Witt Jr. fans.</p>
